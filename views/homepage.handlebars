            <p class="p-2">
                SkittyDex is a an app for trainers looking to build their ideal team,
                whether it be for battling, contest, aesthetics, or even just pokemon they love.
                The goal is for trainers to share their teams, as well as provide feedback
                on other trainer's teams to help each other grow.
                Currently, SkittyDex is optimized for the Sinnoh Regional pokedex (Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining
                Pearl)
                with future updates to expand post game and to other regions and games.
